WrongZoom
=========

WrongZoom is an open-source SIMBL plugin for Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 to change all Cocoa apps to make the green button maximize windows instead of zooming them to fit content like Mac OS X does by default.

If you're not a developer, you probably want to **[download the plugin](http://cdn.cloudfiles.mosso.com/c39102/wrongzoom1.0.1.zip)**. Once you've downloaded the plugin, make sure you have [SIMBL](http://www.culater.net/software/SIMBL/SIMBL.php) installed, then copy `WrongZoom.bundle` to `~/Library/Application Support/SIMBL/Plugins/`.

Please feel free to fork this project and make improvements!
